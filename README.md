# Static_Effect
This code sets up a Pygame window and continuously generates random noise (randomly colored pixels) to simulate a static TV effect. Press the close button on the window to exit the program.  You can adjust the parameters, such as screen size and the number of static pixels generated, to customize the effect to your liking.
